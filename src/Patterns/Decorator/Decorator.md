# Decorator.md

The decorator design patterns helps you extend an existing class to add some logic to it,
without modifying the original class.

The more basic example is, adding some logging informations to a class,
without breaking its functionalities.
Rather than modifying the original class, create a decorator class for it,
add your logging rules, and use this new class in your code.

See code and rendering example to understand this notion.
